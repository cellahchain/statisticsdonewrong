``При достаточном количестве глаз, все ошибки выплывают на поверхность.''
\end{chapquote}


Ранее мы говорили о наиболее распространенных ошибках, которые допускают учёные, и о том, что наилучший способ их обнаружить - тщательное изучение извне. Экспертная оценка, в некоторой степени этому способствует, однако у человека, проводящего оценку, недостаточно времени для того, чтобы подробно проанализировать все данные повторно и проверить все исходные коды анализа на ошибки, - рецензенты могут лишь проверить правильность выбранной методологии исследования. Иногда они замечают очевидные ошибки, но едва заметные проблемы, как правило, пропускают. \cite{schroter_what_2008}  


Поэтому многие рецензируемые журналы и профессиональные сообщества требуют от исследователей предоставлять другим исследователям доступ к своим данным по запросу. Полные наборы данных, как правило, слишком большие по размеру, чтобы их можно было напечатать на страницах журнала, поэтому авторы лишь публикуют свои результаты в статьях, а копию данных отправляют другим исследователям по запросу. Возможно, другие исследователи смогут обнаружить ошибку или незамеченную закономерность.

Теоретически, именно так это и должно происходить. В 2005 году Джелте Уичертс с коллегами из университета Амстердама решили проанализировать недавно опубликованные статьи в нескольких знаменитых журналов Американской Психологической Ассоциации, чтобы узнать об использованных в них статистических методах. Они выбрали журналы АПА отчести потому, что это сообщество требует от авторов статей согласие на предоставление собранных в рамках исследования данных другим психологам, стремящихся проверить их результаты. 

Шесть месяцев спустя они смогли получить данные только по 64 исследованиям из 249 анализируемых. Почти три четверти авторов статей так и не прислали им свои данные. \cite{wicherts_willingness_2011} 

Конечно, учёные - занятые люди и, возможно, у них просто не нашлось свободного времени, чтобы собрать свои даные, подготовить пояснительные документы, описывающие значения каждой переменной и каким образом она была измерена, и так далее.

Уитчерс и его коллеги решили проверить.

Wicherts and his colleagues decided they’d test this. They trawled through all the studies looking for common errors which could be spotted by reading the paper, such as inconsistent statistical results, misuse of various statistical tests, and ordinary typos. At least half of the papers had an error, usually minor, but 15\% reported at least one statistically significant result which was only significant because of an error.

Next, they looked for a correlation between these errors and an unwillingness to share data. There was a clear relationship. Authors who refused to share their data were more likely to have committed an error in their paper, and their statistical evidence tended to be weaker.60 Because most authors refused to share their data, Wicherts could not dig for deeper statistical errors, and many more may be lurking.

This is certainly not proof that authors hid their data out of fear their errors may be uncovered, or even that the authors knew about the errors at all. Correlation doesn’t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing “look over there.”[1]


\section{Just leave out the details}
\label{chp10:leaveoutdetails}

Nitpicking statisticians getting you down by pointing out flaws in your paper? There’s one clear solution: don’t publish as much detail! They can’t find the errors if you don’t say how you evaluated your data.

I don’t mean to seriously suggest that evil scientists do this intentionally, although perhaps some do. More frequently, details are left out because authors simply forgot to include them, or because journal space limits force their omission.

It’s possible to evaluate studies to see what they left out. Scientists leading medical trials are required to provide detailed study plans to ethical review boards before starting a trial, so one group of researchers obtained a collection of these plans from a review board. The plans specify which outcomes the study will measure: for instance, a study might monitor various symptoms to see if any are influenced by the treatment. The researchers then found the published results of these studies and looked for how well these outcomes were reported.

Roughly half of the outcomes never appeared in the scientific journal papers at all. Many of these were statistically insignificant results which were swept under the rug.[2] Another large chunk of results were not reported in sufficient detail for scientists to use the results for further meta-analysis.14

Other reviews have found similar problems. A review of medical trials found that most studies omit important methodological details, such as stopping rules and power calculations, with studies in small specialist journals faring worse than those in large general medicine journals.29

Medical journals have begun to combat this problem with standards for reporting of results, such as the CONSORT checklist. Authors are required to follow the checklist’s requirements before submitting their studies, and editors check to make sure all relevant details are included. The checklist seems to work; studies published in journals which follow the guidelines tend to report more essential detail, although not all of it.46 Unfortunately the standards are inconsistently applied and studies often slip through with missing details nonetheless.42 Journal editors will need to make a greater effort to enforce reporting standards.

We see that published papers aren’t faring very well. What about unpublished studies?

\section{Science in a filing cabinet}
\label{chp10:sciencecabinet}


Earlier we saw the impact of multiple comparisons and truth inflation on study results. These problems arise when studies make numerous comparisons with low statistical power, giving a high rate of false positives and inflated estimates of effect sizes, and they appear everywhere in published research.

But not every study is published. We only ever see a fraction of medical research, for instance, because few scientists bother publishing “We tried this medicine and it didn’t seem to work.”

Consider an example: studies of the tumor suppressor protein TP53 and its effect on head and neck cancer. A number of studies suggested that measurements of TP53 could be used to predict cancer mortality rates, since it serves to regulate cell growth and development and hence must function correctly to prevent cancer. When all 18 published studies on TP53 and cancer were analyzed together, the result was a highly statistically significant correlation: TP53 could clearly be measured to tell how likely a tumor is to kill you.

But then suppose we dig up unpublished results on TP53: data that had been mentioned in other studies but not published or analyzed. Add this data to the mix and the statistically significant effect vanishes.36 After all, few authors bothered to publish data showing no correlation, so the meta-analysis could only use a biased sample.

A similar study looked at reboxetine, an antidepressant sold by Pfizer. Several published studies have suggested that it is effective compared to placebo, leading several European countries to approve it for prescription to depressed patients. The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, responsible for assessing medical treatments, managed to get unpublished trial data from Pfizer – three times more data than had ever been published – and carefully analyzed it. The result: reboxetine is not effective. Pfizer had only convinced the public that it’s effective by neglecting to mention the studies proving it isn’t.18

This problem is commonly known as publication bias or the file-drawer problem: many studies sit in a file drawer for years, never published, despite the valuable data they could contribute.

The problem isn’t simply the bias on published results. Unpublished studies lead to a duplication of effort – if other scientists don’t know you’ve done a study, they may well do it again, wasting money and effort.

Regulators and scientific journals have attempted to halt this problem. The Food and Drug Administration requires certain kinds of clinical trials to be registered through their website ClinicalTrials.gov before the trials begin, and requires the publication of results within a year of the end of the trial. Similarly, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors announced in 2005 that they would not publish studies which had not been pre-registered.

Unfortunately, a review of 738 registered clinical trials found that only 22\% met the legal requirement to publish.47 The FDA has not fined any drug companies for noncompliance, and journals have not consistently enforced the requirement to register trials. Most studies simply vanish.
